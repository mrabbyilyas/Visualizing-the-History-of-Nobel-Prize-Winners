# Nobel Prize Analysis
 This project visualizes the history of Nobel Prize winners, exploring trends such as the proportion of USA-born winners over decades, the categories with the highest proportion of female winners, and identifying the first female Nobel laureate.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot

## Data Loading
The data is loaded from a CSV file named "nobel.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.

## Data Analysis
The script performs several analyses on the data:

1. It identifies the most common gender and birth country among the Nobel laureates.
2. It creates a new column "usa_born_winner" to indicate whether the laureate was born in the United States.
3. It creates a new column "decade" to group the laureates by the decade of their award.
4. It calculates the proportion of USA-born laureates for each decade and identifies the decade with the highest proportion.
5. It creates a line plot to visualize the proportion of USA-born laureates over the decades.
6. It creates a new column "female_winner" to indicate whether the laureate is female.
7. It calculates the proportion of female laureates for each decade and category, and identifies the decade and category with the highest proportion.
8. It identifies the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and her category.
9. It generates a list of laureates who have won the Nobel Prize more than once.

## Visualization
The script uses seaborn to create a line plot showing the proportion of USA-born laureates over the decades.
